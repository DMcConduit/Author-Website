                <h1>DJ and the Zulu Parade</h1>
                <p>
                Every child loves the fun and excitement of wearing costumes and 
                pretending. Now imagine if you got the chance to dress up and ride 
                in a Mardi Gras parade. That is exactly what happens to the main 
                character in D.J. and the Zulu Parade. Yet riding on the popular 
                Zulu parade on Fat Tuesday, dressed as a page to the queen of Zulus, 
                he finds that along with the thrills comes some concerns. Like any 
                child thrown into a new situation, young D.J. finds that it can be 
                quite overwhelming. D.J has to cope with his fears of falling off the 
                float, of what his costume will be, and about the make-up he will have 
                to wear.
                <br>
                <br>
                This book answers many questions children have about the customs and 
                traditions of their own heritage, and it does so in a way children can 
                understand and relate to. They can see their own fears and worries in D.J.â€™s
                view of the experience.
