                <h1>DJ and the Jazz Fest</h1>
                <p>
                    Where in the world can children hear jazz, gospel, blues, and Cajun music? 
                    Where can they eat foods like shrimp po’ boys and strawberry snowballs? 
                    Where can they buy handmade crafts and see performances of all kinds by 
                    people of all ages? They can do all of this and more only at Jazz Fest in 
                    New Orleans!
                <br>
                <br>    
                    D.J. reluctantly agrees to go to his first Jazz Fest with his mother and 
                    her godmother, Nanan. Looking cool in his favorite baseball cap and new 
                    sunglasses, D.J. first notices the large crowd of people and the huge tents 
                    everywhere that hold the stages for the performers.
                <br>
                <br>    
                    At the Children’s Tent, girls perform an Oriental dance and a boy D.J.’s size 
                    breaks boards with his foot! D.J. meets his cousin, Jonathan, in the Children’s 
                    Tent, and they go on to have a great day filled with food, music, and crafts. 
                    As D.J. would say himself, “It was a great Jazz Fest weekend indeed!”
